nor should you use the Services unless you understand and agree to these Terms.
1. INTRODUCTORY PROVISIONS
1.1. These GTC govern your (“you”, “your”, or the “Customer”) rights and obligations in

NOT GIVE OR PROVIDE TO YOU ANY GUIDANCE, INSTRUCTIONS, OR INFORMATION
ABOUT HOW OR IN WHICH MANNER YOU SHOULD PERFORM TRANSACTIONS WHEN
USING THE SERVICES OR OTHERWISE, OR ANY OTHER SIMILAR INFORMATION ABOUT
THE INVESTMENT TOOLS TRADED, NOR DOES THE PROVIDER ACCEPT ANY SUCH
GUIDANCE, INSTRUCTIONS, OR INFORMATION FROM YOU. NONE OF THE SERVICES
CONSTITUTE INVESTMENT ADVICE OR RECOMMENDATIONS. NO EMPLOYEES, STAFF, OR
REPRESENTATIVES OF THE PROVIDER ARE AUTHORIZED TO PROVIDE INVESTMENT

1.7. Your personal data is processed in accordance with the Privacy Policy.
1.8. The meaning of the definitions, expressions, and abbreviations used in these GTC can be
found in clause 18.
2. SERVICES AND THEIR ORDER
2.1. You can order the Services through the Website by completing the appropriate registration
or order form. After registration, we will e-mail you the login details for the Client Section
and/or Trading Platform and allow you to access them.
2.2. The Services include, among other things, the Free Trial, FTMO Challenge, and Verification
products; these products may differ in the scope of the Services provided
(e.g., by analytical tools available to the Customer). With the Free Trial, you may use
some of the Services within a limited scope and for a limited period free of charge.
Completing the Free Trial does not entitle you to access any other Services.
2.3. All data that you provide to us through the registration or order form, the Client Section,
or otherwise must be complete, true, and up to date. You must immediately notify us
of any change in your data or update the data in your Client Section. The Customer is
responsible for all the provided data being accurate and up to date; the Provider is not
obligated to verify the data.
2.4. You acknowledge that if you provide an identification number, tax registration number
or other similar information in the registration or order form or in the Client Section,
or if you state that you are a legal entity, you will be considered as an entrepreneur
(trader) for the purposes of these GTC and when using the Services, and the provisions
of these GTC or the applicable law that grant rights to consumers will not apply to you.
2.5. The fee for the FTMO Challenge varies according to the option selected and depends on
the amount of the initial capital, the degree of the acceptable risk, the parameters that
must be fulfilled so that the conditions of the FTMO Challenge and the subsequent
Verification are met, and possibly other configurations. More detailed information on
individual options and fees for those options are provided on our Website here. The final
fee will be determined based on the option you select when completing the form for
ordering the FTMO Challenge. The Provider reserves the right to also provide the Services
under individually agreed conditions. All individually agreed conditions shall be determined
by the Provider at its own discretion. Individual discounts and other benefits may not be
combined, unless expressly stipulated otherwise by the Provider.
2.6. The fee is paid for allowing you to access the FTMO Challenge, or the Services provided
under the FTMO Challenge. The Customer is not entitled to a refund of the fee, for
example, if the Customer cancels the Customer’s Client Section or requests the
cancellation by e-mail, if the Customer terminates the use of the Services or the contract
(for example, fails to complete the FTMO Challenge or the Verification), fails to meet the
conditions of the FTMO Challenge or the Verification, or violates these GTC.
2.7. If the Customer lodges an unjustifiable complaint regarding the paid fee or disputes
the paid fee with the Customer’s bank or payment service provider (e.g. through
chargeback services, dispute services, or other similar services), on the basis of which
an annulment, cancellation or refund of the fee or any part thereof is requested,
the Provider is entitled, at its own discretion, to stop providing to the Customer any
services and refuse any future provision of any services.
2.8. Your choice of the option of the FTMO Challenge that you select when making an order
shall also apply to the subsequent Verification. You will start the subsequent Verification
and, possibly, other products related thereto, with the parameters and the same currency
that correspond to the option of the FTMO Challenge selected by you. Once you make a
selection, it is not possible to change it.
If you are ordering a new FTMO Challenge, the restrictions specified in this clause 2.8
shall not apply.
3/15
2.9. The Provider reserves the right to unilaterally change the fees and parameters
of the Services at any time, including the parameters for their successful completion.
The change does not affect the Services purchased before the change is notified.
2.10. Any data entered in the order form can be checked, corrected, and amended until
the binding order of the Services. The order of the Services of your choice is made by
submitting the order form. The Provider will immediately confirm the receipt of your order
to your e-mail address. In the case of the Free Trial, the order is completed upon the
delivery of the confirmation to your e-mail address, whereby the contract is executed.
In the case of the FTMO Challenge, the order is completed upon the payment of the fee
for the selected option (more on this in clause 3.4), whereby the contract between you
and the Provider is executed, the subject of which is the provision of the FTMO Challenge
and, if the conditions of the FTMO Challenge are met, the Verification. The contract is
concluded in English. We archive the contract in electronic form and do not allow access
to it.
2.11. You acknowledge that in order to use our Services, you must obtain the appropriate
technical equipment and software, including third-party software (e.g., software for
the use of the Trading Platform), at your own risk and expense. The Website is accessible
from the most commonly used web browsers. The internet access, purchase of the
equipment, and purchase of the web browser and its updates are at your own risk
and expense. The Provider does not warrant or guarantee that the Services will be
compatible with any specific equipment or software. The Provider does not charge any
additional fees for the internet connection.
2.12. You acknowledge that the operators of trading platforms are persons or entities different
from the Provider and that their own terms and conditions and privacy policies will apply
when you use their services and products. Before sending an order form, you are obligated
to read those terms and conditions and privacy policies.
2.13. If the Customer places an unusually large number of orders for the Services within an
unreasonably short period of time, the Provider may notify the Customer through the
Client Section as a protective precaution to mitigate potentially harmful behaviour of the
Customer. If such unreasonable behaviour continuous after such notice, we reserve the
right to suspend any further orders of the Services by the Customer. If we identify that
the unusual behaviour as per this paragraph relates to the Customer’s involvement in
Forbidden Trading Practices, we may take respective actions as perceived in Section 5 of
this GTC. The Provider reserves the right to determine, at its own discretion, the nature
of the behaviour described above and reasonable boundaries for such determination.
3. PAYMENT TERMS
3.1. The amounts of fees for the FTMO Challenge options are in euros. The fee can also be paid
in other currencies that are listed on the Website. If you select any other currency than
the euro, the amount of the fee for the selected option of the FTMO Challenge shall be
converted by our rates and it will automatically display your payment total in your chosen
currency, so you know how much you are paying before you confirm the order. The
Customer acknowledges that if the payment is made in a currency other than the one the
Customer has chosen on the Website, the amount will be converted according to the
current exchange rates valid at the time of payment.
3.2. Service charges are inclusive of all taxes. If the Customer is an entrepreneur (trader), he
is obliged to fulfil all his tax obligations in connection with the use of our Services in
accordance with applicable law, and in the event of an obligation, he is obliged to pay tax
or other fees properly.
3.3. You can pay the fee for the selected option of the FTMO Challenge by a payment card, via
a bank transfer, or using other means of payment that the Provider currently offers on the
Website.
3.4. In the event of payment by a payment card or via any other express payment method,
the payment shall be made immediately. If you select a bank transfer for payment, we
will subsequently send you a proforma invoice in electronic form with the amount of the
fee for the option of the FTMO Challenge you have chosen on the Website. You undertake
to pay the amount within the period specified in the proforma invoice. The fee is
considered paid when its full amount is credited to the Provider’s account. If you do not
4/15
pay the amount on time, the Provider is entitled to cancel your order. Customer bears all
fees charged to Customer by the selected payment service provider (according to the valid
pricelist of the payment service provider) in connection with the transaction and the
Customer is obliged to ensure that the respective fee for the selected FTMO Challenge is
paid in full.
4. CLIENT SECTION AND TRADING PLATFORM
4.1. Only one Client Section is permitted per Customer and all of the Customer’s Services must
be maintained in the Client Section.
4.2. The total number of FTMO Challenges and Verifications per one Client Section may be
limited depending on the total sum of the initial capital amounts of the products ordered
by the Customer or on the basis of other parameters. Unless the Provider grants an
exception to the Customer, the initial capital amounts may not be transferred between the
individual products or mutually combined. You may also not transfer or combine your
performance, Service parameters, data, or any other information between the products.
4.3. Access to the Client Section and Trading Platform is protected by login data, which
the Customer may not make available or share with any third party. If the Customer has
registered as a legal entity, the Customer may allow the use of the Services through the
Customer’s Client Section to the authorized employees and representatives. The Customer
is responsible for all activities that are performed through the Customer’s Client Section
or Trading Platform. The Provider bears no responsibility, and the Customer is not entitled
to any compensation, for any misuse of the Client Section, Trading Platform, or any part
of the Services, nor is the Provider responsible for any negative consequences thereof for
the Customer, if such misuse occurs for any reasons on the part of the Customer.
4.4. The Customer acknowledges that the Services may not be available around the clock,
particularly with respect to maintenance, upgrades, or any other reasons. In particular,
the Provider bears no responsibility, and the Customer is not entitled to any compensation,
for the unavailability of the Client Section or Trading Platform and for damage or loss
of any data or other content that Customer uploads, transfers or saves through the Client
Section or Trading Platform.
4.5. The Customer may at any time request the cancellation of the Client Section by sending
an e-mail to support@ftmo.com. Sending a request for the cancellation of the Client
Section is considered as a request for termination of the contract by the Customer, with
the Customer being no longer entitled to use the Services, including the Client Section
and Trading Platform. The Provider will immediately confirm the receipt of the request to
the Customer by e-mail, whereby the contractual relationship between the Customer and
the Provider will be terminated. In such a case, the Customer is not entitled to any refund
of the fees already paid or costs otherwise incurred.
5. RULES OF DEMO TRADING

OR OTHER HARM AS A RESULT OF THE CUSTOMER’S ACTIVITIES (E.G.
OVERLEVERAGING, OVEREXPOSURE, ONE-SIDED BETS, ACCOUNT
ROLLING).
5.4.2. As our Customer, you should understand and agree that all our Services are
for Customer’s personal use only, meaning that only you personally can access
your FTMO Challenge and Verification accounts and perform trades. For that
reason, you should not, and you agree not to,
(a) allow access to and trading on your FTMO Challenge and Verification
accounts by any third party nor you shall engage or cooperate with any
third party in order to have such third party perform trades for you,
whether such third party is a private person or a professional;

on behalf of any third party or perform any account management or
similar services, where you agree to trade, operate or manage the FTMO
Challenge and Verification accounts on behalf of another user, all whether
performed as a professional or otherwise.
Please note that if you act or behave in contradiction with the aforesaid, we
will consider such action/behaviour as a Forbidden Trading Practice under
Section 5.4. with respective consequences as perceived under this GTC.
5.4.3. Furthermore, Customer shall not exploit the Services by performing trades
without applying market standard risk management rules for trading on
financial markets, this includes, among others, the following practices (i)
opening substantially larger position sizes compared to Customer’s other
6/15
trades, whether on this or any other Customer’s account, or (ii) opening
substantially smaller or larger number of positions compared to Customer’s
other trades, whether on this or any other Customer’s account.
The Provider reserves the right to determine, at its own discretion, whether certain trades,
practices, strategies, or situations are Forbidden Trading Practices.
5.5. If the Customer engages in any of the Forbidden Trading Practices described in clause 5.4,
(i) the Provider may consider it as a failure to meet the conditions of the particular FTMO
Challenge or Verification, (ii) the Provider may remove the transactions that violate
the prohibition from the Customer’s trading history and/or not count their results in the
profits and/or losses achieved by the demo trading, (iii) to immediately cancel all Services
provided to the Customer and subsequently terminate this contract, or (iv) reduce the
offered leverage on products to 1:5 on any or all Customer’s accounts.
5.6. In case when some or all Forbidden Trading Practices are executed on one or more FTMO
Challenge and Verification accounts of one Customer, or accounts of various Customers,
or by combining trading through FTMO Challenge and Verification accounts and FTMO
Trader accounts, then the Provider is entitled to cancel all Services and terminate all
respective contracts related to any and all Customer’s FTMO Challenge and Verification
accounts and/or apply other measures in Clause 5.5. The Provider may exercise any and
all actions in Clauses 5.5 and 5.6 at its own discretion.
5.7. If any FTMO Trader accounts were used for or were involved in the Forbidden Trading
Practices, this may and will constitute a breach of respective terms and conditions for
FTMO Trader account with third-party provider and may result in cancellation of all such
user accounts and termination of respective agreements by the third-party provider.
5.8. If the Customer engages in any of the practices described in clause 5.4 repeatedly,
and the Provider has previously notified the Customer thereof, the Provider may prevent
the Customer from accessing all Services or their parts, including access to the Client
Section and Trading Platform, without any compensation. In such a case, the Customer is
not entitled to a refund of the fees paid.
5.9. The Provider does not bear any responsibility for trading or other investment activities
performed by the Customer outside the relationship with the Provider, for example
by using data or other information from the Client Section, Trading Platform, or otherwise
related to the Services in real trading on financial markets, not even if the Customer uses
for such trading the same Trading Platform that the Customer uses for demo trading.
5.10. DEVELOPMENTS IN FINANCIAL MARKETS ARE SUBJECT TO FREQUENT AND ABRUPT
CHANGES. TRADING ON FINANCIAL MARKETS MAY NOT BE PROFITABLE AND CAN LEAD
TO SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL LOSSES. ANY PREVIOUS PERFORMANCES AND PROFITS OF
THE CUSTOMER’S DEMO TRADING ARE NOT A GUARANTEE OR INDICATION OF ANY
FURTHER PERFORMANCE.

2.1. You can order the Services through the Website by completing the appropriate registration
or order form. After registration, we will e-mail you the login details for the Client Section
and/or Trading Platform and allow you to access them.
2.2. The Services include, among other things, the Free Trial, FTMO Challenge, and Verification
products; these products may differ in the scope of the Services provided
(e.g., by analytical tools available to the Customer). With the Free Trial, you may use
some of the Services within a limited scope and for a limited period free of charge.
Completing the Free Trial does not entitle you to access any other Services.
2.3. All data that you provide to us through the registration or order form, the Client Section,
or otherwise must be complete, true, and up to date. You must immediately notify us
of any change in your data or update the data in your Client Section. The Customer is
responsible for all the provided data being accurate and up to date; the Provider is not
obligated to verify the data.
2.4. You acknowledge that if you provide an identification number, tax registration number
or other similar information in the registration or order form or in the Client Section,
or if you state that you are a legal entity, you will be considered as an entrepreneur
(trader) for the purposes of these GTC and when using the Services, and the provisions
of these GTC or the applicable law that grant rights to consumers will not apply to you.
2.5. The fee for the FTMO Challenge varies according to the option selected and depends on
the amount of the initial capital, the degree of the acceptable risk, the parameters that
must be fulfilled so that the conditions of the FTMO Challenge and the subsequent
Verification are met, and possibly other configurations. More detailed information on
individual options and fees for those options are provided on our Website here. The final
fee will be determined based on the option you select when completing the form for
ordering the FTMO Challenge. The Provider reserves the right to also provide the Services
under individually agreed conditions. All individually agreed conditions shall be determined
by the Provider at its own discretion. Individual discounts and other benefits may not be
combined, unless expressly stipulated otherwise by the Provider.
2.6. The fee is paid for allowing you to access the FTMO Challenge, or the Services provided
under the FTMO Challenge. The Customer is not entitled to a refund of the fee, for
example, if the Customer cancels the Customer’s Client Section or requests the
cancellation by e-mail, if the Customer terminates the use of the Services or the contract
(for example, fails to complete the FTMO Challenge or the Verification), fails to meet the
conditions of the FTMO Challenge or the Verification, or violates these GTC.
2.7. If the Customer lodges an unjustifiable complaint regarding the paid fee or disputes
the paid fee with the Customer’s bank or payment service provider (e.g. through
chargeback services, dispute services, or other similar services), on the basis of which
an annulment, cancellation or refund of the fee or any part thereof is requested,
the Provider is entitled, at its own discretion, to stop providing to the Customer any
services and refuse any future provision of any services.
2.8. Your choice of the option of the FTMO Challenge that you select when making an order
shall also apply to the subsequent Verification. You will start the subsequent Verification
and, possibly, other products related thereto, with the parameters and the same currency
that correspond to the option of the FTMO Challenge selected by you. Once you make a
selection, it is not possible to change it.
If you are ordering a new FTMO Challenge, the restrictions specified in this clause 2.8
shall not apply.

of the Services at any time, including the parameters for their successful completion.
The change does not affect the Services purchased before the change is notified.
2.10. Any data entered in the order form can be checked, corrected, and amended until
the binding order of the Services. The order of the Services of your choice is made by
submitting the order form. The Provider will immediately confirm the receipt of your order
to your e-mail address. In the case of the Free Trial, the order is completed upon the
delivery of the confirmation to your e-mail address, whereby the contract is executed.
In the case of the FTMO Challenge, the order is completed upon the payment of the fee
for the selected option (more on this in clause 3.4), whereby the contract between you
and the Provider is executed, the subject of which is the provision of the FTMO Challenge
and, if the conditions of the FTMO Challenge are met, the Verification. The contract is
concluded in English. We archive the contract in electronic form and do not allow access
to it.

2.12. You acknowledge that the operators of trading platforms are persons or entities different
from the Provider and that their own terms and conditions and privacy policies will apply
when you use their services and products. Before sending an order form, you are obligated
to read those terms and conditions and privacy policies.
2.13. If the Customer places an unusually large number of orders for the Services within an
unreasonably short period of time, the Provider may notify the Customer through the
Client Section as a protective precaution to mitigate potentially harmful behaviour of the
Customer. If such unreasonable behaviour continuous after such notice, we reserve the
right to suspend any further orders of the Services by the Customer. If we identify that
the unusual behaviour as per this paragraph relates to the Customer’s involvement in
Forbidden Trading Practices, we may take respective actions as perceived in Section 5 of
this GTC. The Provider reserves the right to determine, at its own discretion, the nature
of the behaviour described above and reasonable boundaries for such determination.
3. PAYMENT TERMS

in other currencies that are listed on the Website. If you select any other currency than

4. CLIENT SECTION AND TRADING PLATFORM
4.1. Only one Client Section is permitted per Customer and all of the Customer’s Services must
be maintained in the Client Section.
4.2. The total number of FTMO Challenges and Verifications per one Client Section may be
limited depending on the total sum of the initial capital amounts of the products ordered
by the Customer or on the basis of other parameters. Unless the Provider grants an
exception to the Customer, the initial capital amounts may not be transferred between the
individual products or mutually combined. You may also not transfer or combine your
performance, Service parameters, data, or any other information between the products.
4.3. Access to the Client Section and Trading Platform is protected by login data, which
the Customer may not make available or share with any third party. If the Customer has

particularly with respect to maintenance, upgrades, or any other reasons. In particular,
the Provider bears no responsibility, and the Customer is not entitled to any compensation,

of any data or other content that Customer uploads, transfers or saves through the Client
Section or Trading Platform.
4.5. The Customer may at any time request the cancellation of the Client Section by sending
an e-mail to support@ftmo.com. Sending a request for the cancellation of the Client
Section is considered as a request for termination of the contract by the Customer, with
the Customer being no longer entitled to use the Services, including the Client Section
and Trading Platform. The Provider will immediately confirm the receipt of the request to
the Customer by e-mail, whereby the contractual relationship between the Customer and
the Provider will be terminated. In such a case, the Customer is not entitled to any refund
of the fees already paid or costs otherwise incurred.

or by combining trading through FTMO Challenge and Verification accounts and FTMO
Trader accounts, then the Provider is entitled to cancel all Services and terminate all
respective contracts related to any and all Customer’s FTMO Challenge and Verification
accounts and/or apply other measures in Clause 5.5. The Provider may exercise any and
all actions in Clauses 5.5 and 5.6 at its own discretion.

FTMO GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS
These FTMO General Terms and Conditions (the “GTC”) govern rights and obligations in connection
with the use of services provided by FTMO Evaluation Global s.r.o. (the “Services”), offered mainly
through the www.ftmo.com website (the “Website”). Please read these GTC carefully. You are
under no obligation to use the Services if you do not agree or understand any portion of these Terms,
nor should you use the Services unless you understand and agree to these Terms.
1. INTRODUCTORY PROVISIONS
1.1. These GTC govern your (“you”, “your”, or the “Customer”) rights and obligations in
connection with the use of the Services provided by FTMO Evaluation Global s.r.o., with
its registered office at Purkyňova 2121/3, Nové Město, 110 00 Prague 1, Czech Republic,
identification no.: 092 13 651, registered in the Commercial Register maintained
by the Municipal Court in Prague, file no. C 332660 (“we”, “our”, or the “Provider”).
1.2. By registering on the Website or, where registration is not required, not later than by your
first use of the Services, you are entering into a contract with the Provider, the subject of
which is the provision of the Services of your choice. The GTC form an integral part of
such a contract and, by executing the contract with the Provider, you express your
agreement to these GTC.
1.3. The Services are only intended for persons over the age of 18 residing in the country
for which the Services are available. By registering on the Website, you confirm that you
are over 18 years of age. If you are under 18 years of age, you may not use the Services.
You undertake to access the Services solely from one of the countries for which
the Services are available. You acknowledge that your access to and use of the Services
may be restricted or prohibited by law in some countries, and you undertake to only access
and use the Services in accordance with applicable laws.
1.4. The Provider shall not provide Services to Customer that: (i) is of nationality or is residing
in Restricted Jurisdictions; (ii) is established or incorporated, or has a registered office in
Restricted Jurisdictions; (iii) is subject to the relevant international sanctions; or (iv) has
a criminal record related to financial crime or terrorism. Restricted Jurisdictions means
countries determined as such by the Provider and published here on the Website. The
Provider reserves the right to refuse, restrict or terminate the provision of any Services to
Customer as per this Clause 1.4. and such Customer is prohibited to use the Services,
which also includes the use of the Client Section and/or Trading Platform.
1.5. The Services consist of the provision of tools for simulated foreign exchange trading
on the FOREX market or simulated trading with other instruments on other financial
markets, provision of analytical tools, training and educational materials, the access to
the Client Section, and other ancillary services, in particular through the Client Section or
by the provision of access to applications provided by the Provider or third parties.
Financial market information is used in the simulated trading; however, you acknowledge
that any trading that you perform through the Services is not real. You also acknowledge
that the funds provided to you for demo trading are fictitious and that you have no right
to possess those fictitious funds beyond the scope of their use within the Services, and in
particular that they may not be used for any actual trading and that you are not entitled
to the payment of those funds. Unless expressly agreed otherwise, you will not be paid
any remuneration or profits based on the results of your simulated trading, nor will you
be required to pay any losses.
1.6. NONE OF THE SERVICES PROVIDED TO YOU BY THE PROVIDER CAN BE CONSIDERED
INVESTMENT SERVICES IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS. THE PROVIDER DOES
NOT GIVE OR PROVIDE TO YOU ANY GUIDANCE, INSTRUCTIONS, OR INFORMATION
ABOUT HOW OR IN WHICH MANNER YOU SHOULD PERFORM TRANSACTIONS WHEN
USING THE SERVICES OR OTHERWISE, OR ANY OTHER SIMILAR INFORMATION ABOUT
THE INVESTMENT TOOLS TRADED, NOR DOES THE PROVIDER ACCEPT ANY SUCH
GUIDANCE, INSTRUCTIONS, OR INFORMATION FROM YOU. NONE OF THE SERVICES
CONSTITUTE INVESTMENT ADVICE OR RECOMMENDATIONS. NO EMPLOYEES, STAFF, OR
REPRESENTATIVES OF THE PROVIDER ARE AUTHORIZED TO PROVIDE INVESTMENT
ADVICE OR RECOMMENDATIONS. SHOULD ANY INFORMATION OR STATEMENT OF ANY
EMPLOYEE, STAFF, OR REPRESENTATIVES OF THE PROVIDER BE INTERPRETED AS
2/15
INVESTMENT ADVICE OR RECOMMENDATIONS, THE PROVIDER EXPLICITLY DISCLAIMS
THAT THE SAME IS INVESTMENT ADVICE OR RECOMMENDATIONS AND SHALL NOT BE
RESPONSIBLE FOR THEM.
1.7. Your personal data is processed in accordance with the Privacy Policy.
1.8. The meaning of the definitions, expressions, and abbreviations used in these GTC can be
found in clause 18.
2. SERVICES AND THEIR ORDER
2.1. You can order the Services through the Website by completing the appropriate registration
or order form. After registration, we will e-mail you the login details for the Client Section
and/or Trading Platform and allow you to access them.
2.2. The Services include, among other things, the Free Trial, FTMO Challenge, and Verification
products; these products may differ in the scope of the Services provided
(e.g., by analytical tools available to the Customer). With the Free Trial, you may use
some of the Services within a limited scope and for a limited period free of charge.
Completing the Free Trial does not entitle you to access any other Services.
2.3. All data that you provide to us through the registration or order form, the Client Section,
or otherwise must be complete, true, and up to date. You must immediately notify us
of any change in your data or update the data in your Client Section. The Customer is
responsible for all the provided data being accurate and up to date; the Provider is not
obligated to verify the data.
2.4. You acknowledge that if you provide an identification number, tax registration number
or other similar information in the registration or order form or in the Client Section,
or if you state that you are a legal entity, you will be considered as an entrepreneur
(trader) for the purposes of these GTC and when using the Services, and the provisions
of these GTC or the applicable law that grant rights to consumers will not apply to you.
2.5. The fee for the FTMO Challenge varies according to the option selected and depends on
the amount of the initial capital, the degree of the acceptable risk, the parameters that
must be fulfilled so that the conditions of the FTMO Challenge and the subsequent
Verification are met, and possibly other configurations. More detailed information on
individual options and fees for those options are provided on our Website here. The final
fee will be determined based on the option you select when completing the form for
ordering the FTMO Challenge. The Provider reserves the right to also provide the Services
under individually agreed conditions. All individually agreed conditions shall be determined
by the Provider at its own discretion. Individual discounts and other benefits may not be
combined, unless expressly stipulated otherwise by the Provider.
2.6. The fee is paid for allowing you to access the FTMO Challenge, or the Services provided
under the FTMO Challenge. The Customer is not entitled to a refund of the fee, for
example, if the Customer cancels the Customer’s Client Section or requests the
cancellation by e-mail, if the Customer terminates the use of the Services or the contract
(for example, fails to complete the FTMO Challenge or the Verification), fails to meet the
conditions of the FTMO Challenge or the Verification, or violates these GTC.
2.7. If the Customer lodges an unjustifiable complaint regarding the paid fee or disputes
the paid fee with the Customer’s bank or payment service provider (e.g. through
chargeback services, dispute services, or other similar services), on the basis of which
an annulment, cancellation or refund of the fee or any part thereof is requested,
the Provider is entitled, at its own discretion, to stop providing to the Customer any
services and refuse any future provision of any services.
2.8. Your choice of the option of the FTMO Challenge that you select when making an order
shall also apply to the subsequent Verification. You will start the subsequent Verification
and, possibly, other products related thereto, with the parameters and the same currency
that correspond to the option of the FTMO Challenge selected by you. Once you make a
selection, it is not possible to change it.
If you are ordering a new FTMO Challenge, the restrictions specified in this clause 2.8
shall not apply.
3/15
2.9. The Provider reserves the right to unilaterally change the fees and parameters
of the Services at any time, including the parameters for their successful completion.
The change does not affect the Services purchased before the change is notified.
2.10. Any data entered in the order form can be checked, corrected, and amended until
the binding order of the Services. The order of the Services of your choice is made by
submitting the order form. The Provider will immediately confirm the receipt of your order
to your e-mail address. In the case of the Free Trial, the order is completed upon the
delivery of the confirmation to your e-mail address, whereby the contract is executed.
In the case of the FTMO Challenge, the order is completed upon the payment of the fee
for the selected option (more on this in clause 3.4), whereby the contract between you
and the Provider is executed, the subject of which is the provision of the FTMO Challenge
and, if the conditions of the FTMO Challenge are met, the Verification. The contract is
concluded in English. We archive the contract in electronic form and do not allow access
to it.
2.11. You acknowledge that in order to use our Services, you must obtain the appropriate
technical equipment and software, including third-party software (e.g., software for
the use of the Trading Platform), at your own risk and expense. The Website is accessible
from the most commonly used web browsers. The internet access, purchase of the
equipment, and purchase of the web browser and its updates are at your own risk
and expense. The Provider does not warrant or guarantee that the Services will be
compatible with any specific equipment or software. The Provider does not charge any
additional fees for the internet connection.
2.12. You acknowledge that the operators of trading platforms are persons or entities different
from the Provider and that their own terms and conditions and privacy policies will apply
when you use their services and products. Before sending an order form, you are obligated
to read those terms and conditions and privacy policies.
2.13. If the Customer places an unusually large number of orders for the Services within an
unreasonably short period of time, the Provider may notify the Customer through the
Client Section as a protective precaution to mitigate potentially harmful behaviour of the
Customer. If such unreasonable behaviour continuous after such notice, we reserve the
right to suspend any further orders of the Services by the Customer. If we identify that
the unusual behaviour as per this paragraph relates to the Customer’s involvement in
Forbidden Trading Practices, we may take respective actions as perceived in Section 5 of
this GTC. The Provider reserves the right to determine, at its own discretion, the nature
of the behaviour described above and reasonable boundaries for such determination.
3. PAYMENT TERMS
3.1. The amounts of fees for the FTMO Challenge options are in euros. The fee can also be paid
in other currencies that are listed on the Website. If you select any other currency than
the euro, the amount of the fee for the selected option of the FTMO Challenge shall be
converted by our rates and it will automatically display your payment total in your chosen
currency, so you know how much you are paying before you confirm the order. The
Customer acknowledges that if the payment is made in a currency other than the one the
Customer has chosen on the Website, the amount will be converted according to the
current exchange rates valid at the time of payment.
3.2. Service charges are inclusive of all taxes. If the Customer is an entrepreneur (trader), he
is obliged to fulfil all his tax obligations in connection with the use of our Services in
accordance with applicable law, and in the event of an obligation, he is obliged to pay tax
or other fees properly.
3.3. You can pay the fee for the selected option of the FTMO Challenge by a payment card, via
a bank transfer, or using other means of payment that the Provider currently offers on the
Website.
3.4. In the event of payment by a payment card or via any other express payment method,
the payment shall be made immediately. If you select a bank transfer for payment, we
will subsequently send you a proforma invoice in electronic form with the amount of the
fee for the option of the FTMO Challenge you have chosen on the Website. You undertake
to pay the amount within the period specified in the proforma invoice. The fee is
considered paid when its full amount is credited to the Provider’s account. If you do not
4/15
pay the amount on time, the Provider is entitled to cancel your order. Customer bears all
fees charged to Customer by the selected payment service provider (according to the valid
pricelist of the payment service provider) in connection with the transaction and the
Customer is obliged to ensure that the respective fee for the selected FTMO Challenge is
paid in full.
4. CLIENT SECTION AND TRADING PLATFORM

Section is considered as a request for termination of the contract by the Customer, with
